## Base Station
Some people choose to have a dedicated machine, some choose to run everything in virtual machines. As I will not go over everyt part of the setup of a base station, I will reference other peoples work that I found helpfull.

### Virtual Machines
For the people running from a virtual machine, there are a couple of free options. 
- Vmware
  
- Virtual Box

- WSL (2.0)
Windows subsystem for Linux is also a handy way to start with a Cyber Securtiy workstation. This will allow you to run linux native commands from within the native Winodws Command line.
